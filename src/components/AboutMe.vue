      description: 'I\'m Satria, a web developer from Indonesia. I started programming in 2021 and initially wanted to learn Python scripting through a tutorial series on YouTube. However, I quit because the series was taking too long to finish. Later, I made my own Discord server and became interested in making Discord bots. Since Discord API updates frequently, it became challenging to learn the new features, so I switched to web development. I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now I consider myself an intermediate web developer.',
